# Production Deployment Recommendations


PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY:

1. THRESHOLD STRATEGY:
   - Use 80% threshold for immediate investigation
   - Use 60% threshold for enhanced review
   - Use 40% threshold for monitoring alerts

2. RISK-BASED APPROACH:
   - Critical Risk (90%+): Immediate hold/investigation
   - High Risk (70-90%): Priority manual review
   - Medium Risk (50-70%): Enhanced automated checks
   - Low Risk (<50%): Standard processing

3. MONITORING STRATEGY:
   - Track investigation outcomes vs predictions
   - Monitor false positive rates by threshold
   - Adjust thresholds based on business feedback
   - Regular model performance reviews

4. BUSINESS VALUE:
   - Focus on high-dollar amount cases first
   - Prioritize providers with unusual patterns
   - Implement graduated response procedures
   - Track ROI of fraud prevention

5. REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS:
   - Expect 5-10% fraud rate in production
   - Plan for 15-20% false positive rate
   - Budget for manual investigation capacity
   - Prepare staff training on risk categories
